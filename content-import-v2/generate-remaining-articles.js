## Pros and Cons

### What We Love

✅ **Professional-Grade Resin**
Crystal clear when cured. No yellowing after 6 months of UV exposure.

Provides excellent stability and precise positioning. Much better than simple suction cups.

✅ **Easy to Use**
Clear instructions with photos. Beginners can get good results on first try.

✅ **Great Value**
$12.99 for 2-3 repairs = $4-6 per repair. Compare to $75-150 professional service.

✅ **Widely Available**
Found at AutoZone, Walmart, Amazon, and most auto parts stores.

### What Could Be Better

❌ **Temperature Sensitive**
Curing time doubles in cold weather (below 60°F).

Bridge positioning needs care. Shaky hands can create air bubbles.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Phase 1: Preparation (10 minutes)

**Step 1: Clean the Windshield**
- Wash entire windshield with glass cleaner
- Pay special attention to damaged area
- Remove any loose glass chips
- Dry completely with paper towels

**Why it matters**: Dirt prevents proper bonding

**Step 2: Prepare the Damage**
- Use a pin to gently remove debris from chip
- Don't dig or enlarge the damage
- Ensure area is completely dry
- Check from inside for penetration

**Pro tip**: Use compressed air to blow out debris

**Step 3: Choose Your Location**
- Park in shade initially
- Ensure level surface
- Have sunlight access nearby
- Comfortable working position

**Temperature check**: Touch the windshield. It should feel warm but not hot.

### Phase 2: Application (20-30 minutes)

**Step 4: Position the Applicator**
- Center applicator directly over damage
- Ensure suction cups are clean
- Press firmly to create seal
- Check that it's level

**Common mistake**: Off-center positioning leads to incomplete filling

**Step 5: Create Vacuum**
- Pull plunger up slowly
- Hold for 30-60 seconds
- You may see air bubbles being drawn out
- This removes air and moisture

**What you'll see**: Damage may appear darker as air is removed

**Step 6: Inject the Resin**
- Fill applicator chamber with resin
- Don't overfill (follow kit instructions)
- Push plunger down SLOWLY
- Apply steady pressure for 2-3 minutes

**Pro tip**: Slow and steady wins. Rushing creates air bubbles.

**Step 7: Pressure Cycle**
- Hold pressure for 2-3 minutes
- Slowly release plunger
- Let resin settle for 5-10 minutes
- Watch resin fill the damage

**For best results**: Repeat pressure cycle 2-3 times

**Step 8: Remove Applicator**
- Carefully detach applicator
- Add one drop of resin directly on damage
- Place curing strip over resin
- Smooth out any air bubbles

**Important**: Don't skip the extra drop of resin!

### Phase 3: Curing (15-60 minutes)

**Step 9: UV Curing**
- Move vehicle into direct sunlight
- Position so sun hits repair directly
- Wait for cure time (check kit instructions)
- Typical: 15-60 minutes depending on kit

**Temperature affects cure time**:
- 80°F+: 15-30 minutes
- 60-80°F: 30-60 minutes
- Below 60°F: 60-120 minutes

**Alternative**: Use UV lamp if no sunlight available

**Step 10: Final Finishing**
- Remove curing strip carefully
- Use razor blade at 90-degree angle
- Gently scrape off excess resin
- Clean with glass cleaner
- Inspect from both sides

**Pro tip**: Be gentle with the razor. You're just removing excess, not digging.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Rushing the Process
❌ **Mistake**: Trying to finish in 15 minutes
✅ **Solution**: Take your time, especially with resin injection

### 2. Skipping Cleaning
❌ **Mistake**: Not cleaning thoroughly
✅ **Solution**: Spend 5 minutes on proper cleaning

### 3. Wrong Temperature
❌ **Mistake**: Working in cold weather
✅ **Solution**: Wait for warmer day or use garage

### 4. Incomplete Filling
❌ **Mistake**: Not doing multiple pressure cycles
✅ **Solution**: Do 2-3 cycles for deep chips

### 5. Moving Too Soon
❌ **Mistake**: Driving before resin fully cures
✅ **Solution**: Wait at least 1 hour, preferably 24 hours

### 6. Over-scraping
❌ **Mistake**: Digging with razor blade
✅ **Solution**: Gentle surface scraping only

## Pro Tips for Best Results

### Before Application
1. **Warm the resin**: Place bottle in warm water for 5 minutes
2. **Check from inside**: Verify damage hasn't penetrated through
3. **Mark the spot**: Use tape to mark damage location

### During Application
4. **Multiple cycles**: Do 2-3 pressure cycles for better filling
5. **Watch for bubbles**: Clear bubbles indicate good vacuum
6. **Be patient**: Slow resin injection prevents air pockets

### After Application
7. **Cure completely**: Don't rush the curing process
8. **Inspect carefully**: Check from multiple angles
9. **Touch test**: Resin should be completely hard
10. **Wait to drive**: Give it 24 hours for maximum strength

## Troubleshooting Guide

**Problem**: Resin won't flow into damage
**Solution**: Warm resin, ensure good vacuum, try multiple cycles

**Problem**: Air bubbles remain
**Solution**: Do additional pressure cycles, tap applicator gently

**Problem**: Repair looks cloudy
**Solution**: Moisture was present. May need to redo when completely dry

**Problem**: Resin leaking from sides
**Solution**: Ensure good seal with suction cups, check applicator position

**Problem**: Damage still visible
**Solution**: Normal for some visibility. Should be 70-90% improved

## What to Expect

### Immediately After
- Damage should be 70-90% less visible
- Some distortion may be present
- Surface should be smooth
- No spreading of damage

### After 24 Hours
- Resin fully hardened
- Maximum strength restored
- Final appearance set
