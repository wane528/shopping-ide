## Quick Verdict

**Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Supplements Hydra Care** is a liquid hydration supplement designed to increase water intake in cats. Studies show it can **increase total fluid intake and decrease urine specific gravity**, which is valuable for cats prone to **urinary issues** or **kidney disease**.【turn3fetch0】【turn8fetch0】

For many cat owners, Hydra Care is a convenient way to “sneak” more water into their cat’s diet—especially picky drinkers or cats fed mainly dry food. It’s **not a prescription drug**, but it is a useful **hydration support tool** when used alongside wet food and fresh water.

> **Bottom line:** If your cat needs more water and won’t eat enough wet food, Hydra Care is worth discussing with your vet. It’s most helpful for:
> *   Cats with a history of **FLUTD** or **crystals**.
> *   Cats with early to moderate **CKD** who need extra hydration.
> *   Cats who refuse wet food but need more moisture.

## What Is Purina Hydra Care?

**Hydra Care** is a nutrient-enriched liquid supplement (often described as a “nutrient-enriched water” or soft jelly) made by Purina Pro Plan Veterinary Supplements. It’s formulated to:

*   **Promote hydration** by encouraging cats to drink more.
*   **Increase total fluid intake**, compared to cats given only water with dry food.【turn3fetch0】【turn8fetch0】
*   **Decrease urine specific gravity**, meaning more dilute urine, which can help reduce the risk of crystal and stone formation.【turn8fetch0】
*   Support **kidney and urinary tract health** as part of an overall management plan.【turn3fetch0】

It’s labeled as a **non-prescription supplement** and sold through veterinary clinics and online retailers, not as a drug.【turn3fetch0】

## Key Benefits for Cats

### 1. Scientifically Backed Hydration Support

According to Purina and product information, Hydra Care:

*   **Increases total liquid intake** in cats, compared to those given only water alongside dry food.【turn3fetch0】【turn8fetch0】
*   **Decreases urine specific gravity**, indicating more dilute urine, which can be beneficial for urinary health.【turn8fetch0】
*   Contains **nutritional osmolytes** (such as glycine) to support water absorption at the cellular level.【turn3fetch0】【turn8fetch0】

For cats prone to **urinary crystals or stones**, more dilute urine can reduce the likelihood of crystals forming and help manage certain types of uroliths (e.g., struvite).

### 2. Supports Urinary and Kidney Health

While Hydra Care is not a treatment for disease, it is designed to:

*   Support **healthy kidney function** and **urinary tract health** as a complementary supplement.【turn3fetch0】
*   Help cats who would benefit from **additional water intake**, including those with early chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Hydration is critical for preventing **Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease (FLUTD)** and managing chronic kidney disease. If your cat has been diagnosed with either, discuss Hydra Care with your veterinarian as part of a comprehensive care plan.

### 3. Easy to Feed, Great Taste

Most owners report that Hydra Care is **highly palatable**:

*   It has a **soft, jelly-like texture** and a chicken/liver flavor that many cats enjoy.【turn8fetch0】
*   It can be offered:
    *   As a “third bowl” alongside food and water.
    *   Mixed with wet food.
    *   Offered on its own as a treat.

This makes it especially useful for **picky cats** who turn their noses up at plain water.

## Pros and Cons

### Pros

*   ✅ **Proven to increase fluid intake** and decrease urine specific gravity in Purina’s feeding studies.【turn3fetch0】【turn8fetch0】
*   ✅ **Highly palatable** – many cats like the taste and texture, which can be a game-changer for poor drinkers.
*   ✅ **Easy to feed** – no pill-giving or complex dosing; just offer the pouch as a “soup” or topper.
*   ✅ **Non-prescription** – you can buy it without a vet prescription, though you should still consult your vet before use.【turn3fetch0】
*   ✅ **Grain-free and low in calories**, so it fits into many therapeutic diets.

### Cons

*   ❌ **Cost** – Hydra Care is more expensive than simply adding water or broth. It’s an ongoing expense if you feed it daily.
*   ❌ **Not suitable for all cats** – it is not recommended for:
    *   **Kittens**
    *   **Pregnant or lactating queens**
    *   Cats with known **food sensitivities** to milk proteins or specific ingredients.【turn5search1】【turn5search3】
*   ❌ **Some cats may develop soft stools or diarrhea** when introduced to new supplements or flavorings. Always introduce gradually and monitor.
*   ❌ **Not a substitute for proper veterinary care** – it doesn’t treat or cure urinary infections, blockages, or kidney disease.

## Feeding Guide: How to Use Hydra Care

According to Purina’s feeding instructions:【turn3fetch0】【turn8fetch0】

*   **Shake well before feeding.**
*   Feed **one pouch per 5 lbs (about 2.3 kg) of body weight per day** to adult cats.
*   Cats must consume **at least 2 oz per 5 lbs body weight daily** to see benefits.

For example:

*   A **10 lb (4.5 kg) cat** would typically get **2 pouches per day**.
*   A **15 lb (6.8 kg) cat** would get **3 pouches per day**.

**How to serve:**

1.  **As a drink or “soup”**  
    Pour the pouch into a small bowl. Many cats will lap it up like a broth.

2.  **Mixed with wet food**  
    Stir the pouch into wet food to increase moisture content. This is ideal for cats already eating wet food.

3.  **As a topper for dry food**  
    Pour over dry kibble to encourage cats who “only eat dry” to take in more liquid.

**Important:**  
Always ensure your cat has **free access to fresh water**, even when using Hydra Care. This supplement is not a replacement for water.

## Who Should Consider Hydra Care?

Hydra Care may be worth discussing with your vet if your cat:

*   Has a history of:
    *   **FLUTD**
    *   **Urinary crystals or stones**
    *   **Idiopathic cystitis**
*   Has been diagnosed with **early to moderate CKD** and needs extra hydration support.
*   Is a **poor drinker** and primarily eats dry food.
*   Has a medical condition where increasing water intake is recommended (e.g., certain bladder conditions).

It’s **not necessary** for:

*   Healthy cats who already drink well and eat a moisture-rich diet.
*   Cats with advanced kidney disease without your vet’s specific guidance.

## Alternatives to Hydra Care

Hydra Care isn’t the only way to increase your cat’s water intake. Consider these alternatives or complementary strategies:

### 1. Wet Food (Best for Most Cats)

Switching from dry to **wet food** is one of the most effective ways to boost hydration. Wet food typically contains **70–80% moisture**, compared to only about 10% in dry kibble.

If your cat has urinary or kidney issues, talk to your vet about:

*   **Prescription urinary diets**
*   **Kidney-friendly diets**

> **Explore options:**  
> See our roundup of **[Internal Link: Best Cat Food for Urinary Health]** and our comparison of **[Internal Link: Hill's k/d vs. Royal Canin Renal Support]**.

### 2. Water Fountains and Flavoring

*   **Cat water fountains** encourage some cats to drink more by providing moving, filtered water.
*   You can also flavor water with:
    *   A little **tuna juice** (in water, not oil).
    *   **Low-sodium chicken broth** without onion or garlic.

### 3. Broth and Treats

Some brands offer **cat broths** or “soup” treats designed to increase fluid intake. Always check:

*   Ingredients (avoid onion, garlic, high sodium).
*   Calorie content if your cat is overweight.
