    "faqJson": "[{\"question\":\"Can cats recover from FLUTD on their own?\",\"answer\":\"Mild cases of FIC (idiopathic cystitis) may resolve spontaneously within a week, but the pain is significant, and recurrence is high. Never assume a male cat with symptoms will recover on his own, as a blockage is fatal if untreated.\"},{\"question\":\"What is the cost of treating a urinary blockage?\",\"answer\":\"Costs vary by region but typically range from $500 to $3,000 for emergency unblocking and hospitalization. Surgery for stones can be higher. Pet insurance often covers these conditions.\"},{\"question\":\"Is dry food bad for cats with urinary problems?\",\"answer\":\"Not necessarily bad, but dry food has low moisture content (approx 10%), whereas wet food has high moisture (approx 75-80%). For cats prone to urinary issues, a wet diet is highly recommended to maintain dilute urine.\"},{\"question\":\"How can I tell if my cat has crystals or stones?\",\"answer\":\"You cannot see crystals or stones at home. A veterinarian must perform a urinalysis (to see crystals) or X-rays/ultrasound (to see stones).\"}]",

Cats diagnosed in Stage 4 may have months. Early detection is key.\"},{\"question\":\"Is dry food bad for cats with kidney disease?\",\"answer\":\"Dry food is not inherently bad, but its low moisture content is a disadvantage for CKD cats. We strongly recommend a wet-food-based diet to support hydration.\"},{\"question\":\"Can kidney disease be reversed in cats?\",\"answer\":\"No. Chronic Kidney Disease involves permanent scarring of the kidneys. The goal of treatment is to slow the progression and manage symptoms, not cure the disease.\"},{\"question\":\"Are treats okay for CKD cats?\",\"answer\":\"Only give treats that are low in phosphorus and protein. Many prescription brands make specific renal treats. Avoid generic treats, as they can disrupt the dietary balance.\"}]",
